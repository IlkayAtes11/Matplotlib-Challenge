## The Power of Plots

### Analysis

* With the help of the Summary Table, we can see that average volumes of tumors for mice who are threated with ' Capomulin' and ' Ramicane' are smaller than the mice who are treated with other drugs.

* In this study, bar chart shows that the number of mice treated with ' Capomulin' and ' Ramicane' drug regimens are more than the mice who are treated with othr drugs.

* Distribution of mice according to sex is 49% Female and 51% Male.

* When we look at the line plot of Tumor Volume and Timepoint for mouse ID 'l509' which is trreated with Capomulin, we saw that tumor size decrease overtime.

* Scatter plot of 'weight of mice' and 'tumor volume' shows that there is a positive correlation between weight and tumor volume. Our regression analysis supports this finding.
